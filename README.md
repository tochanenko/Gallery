# Gallery Project

**Author:** Vladyslav Tochanenko

**Tech Stack:** React on Frontend, Express on Backend

You can experience the project in two ways:

1. By visiting the deployed version
2. By running Frontend and Backend locally

## Visit the Deployed version

Backend Express app is deployed on Heroku. This Backend is a simple one that doesn't use any database, only a local JSON file is used. The JSON file can be modified both locally and on Heroku, however changes made to deployed app may not be saved.

```
**2. Install Node modules**

```

**3. Run Express.js server**
